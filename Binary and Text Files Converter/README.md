## File Format

The format of the text file to be converted is specified as follows below:
```sh
FirstName LastName ID_Number GPA
```
The file can have an infinite amount of entries as long as the format is correct.
```FirstName``` and ```LastName``` is a ```String```,
```ID_Number``` is an ```int``` and
```GPA``` is a ```float```

Each entry is separated by either a space or a new line.

An example file is given below:
```sh
John Doe 8317 4.0
Jane Doe 34578 4.0
Harry Potter 100 3.5
```
## Development setup
For a quick and easy setup, with the files located in the same directory, compile the code with the command
```sh
gcc converter.c binaryToText.c secondForm.c textToBinary.c -o converter 
```

### Usage example

To convert a text file ```example.txt``` to a binary. It can be achieved as follows:
```./converter -t example.txt outputFile```

### Flags
As in the example above, ```-t``` is a flag that is specified for the program to run. There are 3 flags that can be used in this program.

```-t``` specifies a text file is being converted ```./converter -t TextFile BinaryFile```

```-b``` specifies a binary file is being converted ```./converter -b BinaryFile TextFile```

```-s``` takes in a binary file, finds the longest full name and prints it ```./converter -s BinaryFile```
